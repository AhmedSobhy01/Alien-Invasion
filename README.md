  #### Whispers have become screams, earie lights piercing the once-peaceful night sky, 
  **🛸 Alien invasion is no longer science fiction! 🛸** 
  
</div>

The once-distant nightmare is now a present threat! The clock is ticking, humanity needed a glimpse into the future, a way to predict the enemy's moves before they unfold.

Faced with this impossible challenge, we developed **a simulated realm where strategies are tested, weaknesses exposed, and the enemy's playbook laid bare**. It is humanity's last chance to rewrite the future before the first shot shatters the silence!

## 🕹️ Simulation Modes

Choose how to witness **humanity's last stand**:
- **Interactive Mode:** Watch the battle as it unfolds and let the aliens know you are watching!
- **Silent Mode:** Conduct a silent stealth mission and strategize in secret.

## ⚔️ Battle Scenarios

The fate of Earth rests in your hands! Adapt your strategies and tactics as Earth's and alien forces vary in strength: 

- **Balanced Power:** Engage in a battle where both Earth and alien armies are evenly matched, testing pure strategy.
- **Earth Overpower:** Lead a stronger Earth army against weaker or moderate alien forces for offensive strategies.
- **Alien Overpower:** Face overwhelming alien forces with a weaker Earth army to test defensive tactics.
